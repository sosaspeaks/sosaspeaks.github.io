        <h2 class="sub-heading" style="margin-top: 6rem;">The election is drawing near, and it's been 106 days since Kamala Harris became the Democratic Party's presumptive (and then official) presidential nominee. </h2>
        <p class="post-text">
            When Biden first dropped out in late July, momentum was strong for the Harris campaign. Instead of feeling like November would show an inevitable Trump victory, voters nationwide were enthused by the contrast of a young, glass-ceiling-breaking candidate. However, it takes effort to keep momentum going, and Harris’ campaign has lacked that effort.

                    This article is not written to be an endorsement of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. If Trump has a fair opinion on something, I’ll “give him credit for it”, but it’s rare to come across a sensible view of his. Additionally, though this piece is meant to change your view of Kamala Harris and her campaign, it is not necessarily meant to change your vote on November 5th. If you’d like to vote for her out of adoration for her policies (interesting opinion), do that. If you’d like to vote for her because you believe she’s the lesser of two evils, do that. If you’d like to vote for Donald Trump, you may be too far gone for me to change your mind, so you can go ahead and continue with that. The same goes for people voting for a third party or completely abstaining: do what you want! What I do hope you take from this is that both major candidates are extremely flawed, and the concept of “facts” has been twisted in this election cycle. We must be critical of both parties and their failures to represent and care for the American people.

                <p class="post-text">
                Harris came onto the election cycle scene unprecedentedly late, but as she arrived, she raised a historic amount of money; within 24 hours of Biden’s dropout announcement, the campaign had raised 81 million dollars.<a href="#1" class="textdecor"><sup>1</sup></a> Despite this, she still needed the delegates to get this nomination certified, and that was to happen at the Democratic National Convention in August. However, with this came a speech that started strong and quickly became questionably awful.
                </p>
                    <p class="quote-text" style="text-align: center;margin: 1.6rem;line-height: 2.5rem;">

                        <i>And with this election, and — and with this election, our nation — our nation, with this election, has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism and divisive battles of the past, a chance to chart a new way forward.

                <p class="post-text">
                The speech began with surprisingly good imagery describing Harris’ upbringing, creating good appeal for the working- and middle-class Americans listening in. This transitioned into a brief yet touching story about a friend of hers being sexually abused by her father, which then inspired Kamala to become a prosecutor – “for the people.” You might be thinking, “This sounds pretty nice, and if not that, it’s standard; how could this go wrong?”

                <p class="post-text">
                Well, shortly after, she presents the topic of the border. If the Democratic party were sensible, they’d attack Republican rhetoric on this issue using stone-cold facts. For example, a study directly funded by the U.S. Department of Justice<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> using crime data from Texas concluded that undocumented immigrants commit substantially less crime than U.S.-born citizens; in fact, U.S. citizens “are over two times more likely [to be] arrested for violent crime.” 
                </p>
                    <img src="assets/images/kamalapost1/violent-crime-offending-rates-documentation.jpg" alt="" class="post-image-content">
                <p class="post-text">
                Of course, there are 49 other states in the country, but Texas stands out as not only a Mexico-bordering state but also the only state that records criminal convictions by immigration status.
                </p>
                <p class="post-text">A 2017 study<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> from the Journal of Ethnicity in Criminal Justice also deduces that there is no basis for assuming immigration and crime rates have a direct relationship; in fact, there is stronger evidence to show that increased immigration results in less crime, especially property crime.</p>
                <p class="post-text">
                Contrary to this overwhelming evidence, though, Republicans still spew false and harmful rhetoric about immigrants. For example, at the Republican National Convention, Donald Trump said:
                </p>

                        <i>We also have an illegal immigration crisis, and it’s taking place right now. It’s a massive invasion at our southern border that has spread misery, crime, poverty, disease, and destruction to communities all across our land. Nobody’s ever seen anything like it.

                        <i class='bx bxs-quote-right'></i>

                <p class="post-text">
                Has it truly spread crime? Well, let’s look at even more data.
                </p>
                    <img src="assets/images/kamalapost1/pew-research-immigrant-share-usa.png" alt="" class="post-image-content" style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">

                <p class="post-text">
                Above are three graphs. The first graph was created by the Pew Research Center<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup> using information from the U.S. Census Bureau and describes the percentage of immigrants in the United States population over time, with small notes indicating the amount at different periods. The two other graphs are from the National Crime Victimization Survey<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup> and the Federal Bureau of Investigation<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup>, respectively, and they both represent violent victimizations and arrests in the United States over time. Each graph shares coverage of the period after 2016, and with that, one can see that there is <b>no basis to assume an increase in immigrants leads to an increase in crime.</b>
                </p>
                <p class="post-text">Now, was any of this presented when speaking of the border?</p>
                <p class="post-text"><b>Absolutely not.</b></p>
                <p class="post-text">
                What was presented was dissatisfaction with Trump for “killing” the Border Act of 2024<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup>, which was introduced into the House to tackle “border security and combatting fentanyl” with billions of taxpayer dollars allocated to this cause. Its proposals include massive increases in funding for detention centers – not increasing their quality but increasing their number of beds. Of course, this is a great idea because our immigration detention centers famously have great, humane conditions, like inadequate medical care<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup> and the use of solitary confinement rather than proper mental care<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup>. 
                </p>
                <p class="post-text">
                The topic of fentanyl is also an interesting one; in 2022, 89% of fentanyl traffickers were U.S. citizens<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup>, rather than migrants. Additionally, during 2023, roughly 93% of fentanyl seizures “occurred at legal crossing points or interior vehicle checkpoints, not on illegal migration routes.<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup>”
                </p>
                <p class="post-text">
                This tough attitude on immigration with little basis in fact won’t stop illegal immigration, though. Even if this Border Act finds a way to pass if Harris is elected president, it will not eliminate the motives people have to flee to the United States. It is a similar situation to Republican views on abortion; making abortion illegal will eliminate legal abortions while increasing illegal abortions, which tend to be more unsafe. The number of illegal and legal abortions combined will not see a significant decrease<sup><a href="#11">11</a></sup>, as one has not tackled the <b>reasons</b> women get abortions. In cases where it is not a required medical procedure to save the life of the mother, this need for an abortion is likely to be caused by a lack of sex education<sup><a href="#12">12</a></sup>, a lack of access to contraceptives<sup><a href="#13">13</a></sup>, or a combination of both. In the case of immigration, restricting it further, increasing punishment for illegal crossings, and refusing to make real reforms to the asylum system only increases the desperation of people wanting to immigrate. As a result, they’re more likely to consult cartels in the area and pay to be transported across the border in trailers or trucks, which often overheat and cause death<sup><a href="#14">14</a></sup> for the migrants being “smuggled.”
                </p>
                <p class="post-text">In conclusion, Harris could care less about the facts on immigration. Instead, she’s operating on the assumption that Republicans are correct on the issue, but they’re just not cruel enough about it. <b>Great! What’s next?</b></p>

                Now, maybe she has good reason for being at best ignorant, and at worst deliberately lying. Maybe that is how you truly captivate the American people and sweep the election. Let’s see how the populace responded after this August 22nd speech by taking a look at FiveThirtyEight’s national poll averages.

                This 3.7-point lead has not been re-achieved by Harris since. She hasn’t had a three-point lead or higher since September 18th. Now, she sits at a <b>whopping 0.9-point lead</b>. Before August 22nd, her numbers were quite steadily increasing.

                Yeah, she’s still “good” (from a Democrat perspective) on abortion – that wasn’t a big focal point of the DNC speech, as that’s a very obvious issue she has the upper hand on. She instead spoke of that issue at her other rallies later.

                Besides that, I can’t praise her much. I understand that opinions change, but it is too easy for Republicans to attack her for flip-flopping. In 2018, she was near Bernie Sanders’ level of progressive: in favor of single-payer Medicare for All, supported the Green New Deal, and anti-fracking. None of those are true for Harris’ 2024 campaign, so what happened? CNN’s Dana Bash asked such directly about fracking during Harris’ first interview <sup><a href="#18">18</a></sup>, and this was Harris’ reply:

                        Well, let’s be clear. My values have not changed. I believe it is very important that we take seriously what we must do to guard against what is a clear crisis in terms of the climate. And to do that, we can do what we have accomplished thus far.

                        The Inflation Reduction Act, what we have done to invest by my calculation over t— probably a trillion dollars over the next ten years investing in a clean energy economy. What we’ve already done creating over 300,000 new clean energy jobs. That tells me from my experience as vice president we can do it without banning fracking. In fact, Dana — Dana, excuse me — I cast the tie-breaking vote that actually increased leases for fracking as vice president. So I’m very clear about where I stand.

                <p class="post-text">This implies that fracking is “clean energy”… which it is clearly not.

                <h3 class="sub-heading" id="282" style="text-indent: 4rem; opacity: 60%;">a) 282-256, Blue Iowa</h3>

                    <p class="post-text">In this possibility, Harris loses Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina, while winning Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin... and Iowa? If I wrote this a week ago, I’d sound deranged, and rightfully so. But with the recent Selzer poll<sup><a href="#24">24</a></sup> putting Kamala at 3 points ahead of Trump, blue Iowa is a legitimate possibility. If not that, Trump would win Iowa by a scarily close amount of votes, likely down to the small thousands. In terms of Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina, it’s hard to see Harris win any more than one of these states; <b>MAYBE</b> Georgia and a <i>smaller maybe</i> on North Carolina, but Arizona seems destined to be red.

                    This is if the Dems get unlucky and lose Nevada. They’ll still win but by a mere two electoral votes. If this truly does happen, I’m very uncertain of the Democrats <b>actually winning</b>; what’s more likely is a 2000-style legal dispute commencing. If that does happen, we all know it won’t end well. I guess it’s not much of a path to victory but more of a path to the election being stolen (I sound like a 2020-Stop-The-Steal-Trumper, but Al Gore legitimately did win more votes<sup><a href="#25">25</a></sup> in the state of Florida, with or without the votes that mistakenly went to Pat Buchanan<sup><a href="#26">26</a></sup>).

                    Again, Kamala Harris will still probably be our next president, but I can’t say I’m particularly enthusiastic about it. She has more charisma than Biden, sure, but a sizeable part of her campaign has been built on lies because of the use of right-wing framing on issues. With this, the “inclusive” Democrats seem to be doing nearly the same as the Republicans to fuel anti-immigrant sentiment nationwide. Similarly, there is only emptiness in Harris’ “hopes for peace” in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon. Running on a ticket without Joe Biden gives her a chance to distance herself from his extreme pro-Israel position, but she has failed to take a step toward that, despite it hurting her poll numbers (especially in the swing state of Michigan). With American Muslim voters, <b>Jill Stein</b> and Harris are neck-and-neck, as the former has 42.3% and the latter has 41% of their support<sup><a href="#27">27</a></sup>. Isn’t it puzzling as to why someone would not be comfortable voting for a candidate who refuses to interfere in the mass killing and devastation of their family – whether it be family by blood or faith? <b>Alas, I hate to feel disappointed, because I should have seen this all coming</b>.
