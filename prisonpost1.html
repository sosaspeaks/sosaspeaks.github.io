        <h2 class="sub-heading" style="margin-top: 6rem;">1.7 million people are incarcerated in the American prison system, which supports the overarching prison industrial complex – 1.7 million lives and 1.7 million stories.</h2>
            <p class="post-text">For reference, the prison industrial complex is a system based on the overlapping interests of institutions of incarceration, the government, and private corporations. Of the ~171,600 of those in federal prisons, each of them earns a whopping $0.12 to $1.15 per hour of prison labor, and the pay can be even more abysmal in state prisons and county jails.</p>
            <p>However, this shouldn’t be a surprise; the 13th Amendment spells this out clearly for everyone to see, as it says, “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction”. These inmates may even be forced to create combat helmets for the Department of Defense through the Federal Prison Industries (FPI), which exclusively creates products for the federal government. What helps finish this cycle of labor is the outrageously high recidivism rate – the rate of prisoners relapsing back into criminal behavior and becoming incarcerated – as a study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics showed that, in a study among 24 states in 2008, 82% of prisoners were rearrested at least once during the 10 years that followed their release. The American prison system is insanely flawed, and to rehabilitate criminals and prevent increasing recidivism, we must address the poor conditions and the extreme prevalence of corruption in our prisons. </p>
